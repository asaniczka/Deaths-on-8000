# Analyzing Deaths on Eight-Thousanders

This project aims to collect and organize data on deaths that occurred on eight-thousanders, which are mountains with peaks above 8,000 meters in height.

The project will then clean the data and save it as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Task Description

- Collect data on deaths from two different Wikipedia pages: one for deaths on eight-thousanders and another for deaths specifically on Mount Everest.
- Select relevant tables from the web pages and merge them into a single dataframe.
- Augment the dataframe with the name of the mountain for each record.
- Clean the data by removing unwanted columns and formatting dates into a valid ISO format.
- Save the cleaned data as a CSV file.

## Key Responsibilities

- Pay attention to the data collection process and ensure that all relevant tables are selected.
- Use the lookup table to correctly assign the name of the mountain to each record.
- Remove unnecessary columns to keep the dataframe concise and informative.
- Format the dates correctly to facilitate further analysis.
- Save the cleaned data as a CSV file with appropriate quoting.

## How to Use

1. Install the necessary dependencies: pandas, csv.
2. Run the provided code to collect and organize the data.
3. The cleaned data will be saved as a CSV file named "deaths_on_eight-thousanders.csv".
